--------------------------------------============================----------------------------------------



=========================================Begin with the config.cpp===============================================

	-using notepad++ open up the config.cpp and anywhere you find MyBrandNewMap - replace this with your mapname.
	-fill out your name and a description of the map.
	-save this file but do not close the tab as we will be coming back to this file often.
	-open up the Layers.cfg and at the bottom there is a spot to change out your map name.
	-save this file and close it.(you will only need this again if you add custom textures)
	
	-depending on your knowledge and the complexity of your map. this main config defines everything, from what textures
		will be used, the time, etc.... take a look down the file and browse through reference material to get an idea
		of what is possible with the right know how.

=========================================Starting with L3DT(Creation Route)=========================================

	-Open L3DT
	-Create your new project
		-Designable map				- Create a map through a series of sliders
		-Blank Designable map		- Creates an empty map for you to edit manually (open ocean)
		-Perlin heightmap			- Uses the 'Perlin noise algorithm' to create a "natural" looking map
		-Fractal heightmap			- Uses fractals to create a heightmap?
		-Blank heightfield			- Not sure?
	
	-Following the designable map 	(you do have options, but it is created randomly.)
		-Choose your map scale		-set Hscale to 1 for FPS, 10 for RTS, and upto 500 for a flight sim.
		-Design map size			-dont change, but can be used with research for tiny or very large maps.
		-Map Parameters				-Sliders set to put variation into the generation.
		-Calculation queue			(Various files to be generated for your terrain.)
						Needed  - Design map			- The design map is a high-level map used by the design/inflate algorithm to generate the heightfield.
															One pixel in the design map typically corresponds to a 64Ã—64 tile of heightfield pixels.
						Needed  - Heightfield			- The heightfield is simply a map of altitudes, which is usually rendered as a greyscale image where
															black is the minimum altitude and white is the maximum altitude.
								- Water map				- The water map is a map of water levels and types. This structure, while large in memory, allow us to
															generate water bodies at different levels (ie. lakes) and non-flat water bodies such as rivers.
						Needed  - Attributes map		- The attributes map describes the type of land in each pixel of the texture map or alpha maps (e.g.
															rocks, sand, grassland, jungle, etc).
						Needed  - Terrain normals		- The terrain normals map is a map of vectors perpendicular to the heightfield surface.
															This map is used only for generating the light map.
								- Light map				- The light map is just that - it is a map of the light intensity on the surface of the heightfield.
															It is used when generating the texture map.
								- Texture map			- The texture map is a map of the colour of the terrain heightfield surface, in RGB.
					-2 Other map types-
								- Salinity map			- The salinity map describes the amount and distribution of salt in the water-bodies and water-table
															within the water map. This data is used to assign the location of land types in the attributes map
								- Alpha map				- Alpha maps are images used for run-time texture blending (or 'texture splatting'), which is a
															technique typically used in games to achieve high-resolution terrain detail.
															
	- Completing the wizard will start the generation process, and produce the files above which you selected. depending on the size this can take awhile.
	
	- This is where you want to do the most of the customization to your terrain, you can fine touch small details later.
	
	- Make any modifications and export each map to the L3TD folder you previously made.
		-Export the files AS THESE file names....
		
		- Design map		- 
		- Heightfield		- heightmap (saved as ASC or XYZ) XYZ seems to work with custom georeference coordinates and ASC did not.
		- Attributes		- sat_lco (saved as BMP)
		- Terrain Normals	- normal_lco (saved as BMP)
		
===========================================sFlora program(recomended)==============================================

	- Use a satmap with or without OSM data to generate vegetation automatically.
	- Grampa's Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik-P2Psr-oQ&t=5878s
	- can I use sflora to place buildings?   umm Maybe, still playing with that.
	
================================TerrainBuilder==========================================
	
	- Start out in TerrainBuilder from the DayZ Tools Suite.
		- Create a new folder on your P: drive with whatever name you want
		- Create a new Mapframe
		- Name your new map and direct it to the folder you just created.
			- Click the Create subfolders button, this will create most of the folders you need.
				-data								(DayZ basefolder)
				-source								(DayZ basefolder)
					-landbuilder					(needed by Terrainbuilder)
					-shapefiles						(needed by Terrainbuilder)
					-TerrainBuilder					(Output folder for original files/saves)(Only if using this program)
					
	- Go ahead and start with adding a Mapframe.
	- Your first box is the UTM zone selection, (Click the ... to access the map) this is your timezone for the map, and if you have a tropical map vs a desert map... 
	  this has to be mostly correct.  Determining your Zone is easy(east/west), but the program uses C thru X for the (north/south) the real world only uses N/S for the 
	  2 separate hemispheres, so if you are making a map from a georeference and want things to be accurate, you may have to take a couple tries at it. (you cant zoom in).
	- Next is the Mapframe properties, You will make a name for the project, and determine where all the files are saved. Here you can also auto-create your needed
	  subfolders, if you had not previously done this.  Finally we come to the Easting and Northing..Remember the box from the map, the numbers you put in here, will
	  determine the position of your map inside THAT box.  This is very important when you import a heightmap from QGIS or other georeference software.
		The limits are the boundaries of the box you selected on the map. this all should make a bit more sense in a minute.
	- Generate your terrain for the first time in the Properties window.	
	- Import your previously created files from QGIS or L3DT, and rebuild your terrain from the properties window.
	- Make sure all your files and filepaths are set and in place.
	- Export all your files and Generate your layers in the Properties window.
	- Load up Bulldozer and verify the initial condition of the map.
		- This is where you can make more accurate terrain modifications.
		- If you make any changes, rebuild your terrain, and re-Export your layers in the properties window.
	- Goto File>Export>.wrp and name your file and location.
	- Modify your config.cpp to match the name and location for your .wrp

===========================================Terrain Processor========================================================

	- Useful to transform your terrain/place objects with predefined shapes and layers.
	- 

===========================================Packing it up========================================================

	- Prepare for the pbo creation.
	- A navmesh needs to be in place and referenced in your config.cpp(you will generate one for YOUR map soon)
	- Your .wrp needs to be in place and referenced in your config.cpp

===========================================Addon Builder========================================================

	- Open up the Addon Builder in DayZ Tools
	- Set the names and directories appropriately.
	- In options-List of files to copy directly, paste the following line
	*.emat;*.edds;*.ptc;*.c;*.imageset;*.layout;*.ogg;*.xml;*.nm,*.paa,*.png,*.rvmat,*.wrp
	- double check all your settings.
	- Pack your .pbo
	- Hopefully you have no errors.

===========================================Navmesh Generator========================================================

	- Open up Navmesh Generator in DayZ Tools
	- Modify your config.cpp from your P: source files
	- Goto your local DayZ folder and add the ServerDZNV.cfg
	- Goto your local DayZ folder into the mpmissions, make sure a copy of "dayzOffline.chernarusplus" is in this folder
	- Modify the ServerDZNV.cfg to the empty.mybrandnewmap folder you just created
	- Create a new txt file called navbat.bat and paste in the following line:
		start DayZDiag_x64 -server -mod=@mybrandnewmap -startNavmeshDataServer -port=2302 -config=ServerDZNV.cfg
	- In the local root folder you should now have
		-ServerDZNV.cfg pointing to your missions folder
		-navbat.bat with the pasted code pointing to your @mybrandnewmap Addons folder. which contains your .pbo
	- Double click the navbat.bat, this will lauch a server for your map. Wait for connection
	- Load up NavMeshGenerator, this opens a folder, right click on the NavMeshGenerator.exe and run as Administrator.
	- Generator>Connect Data Server. Hit OK  wait for the connection.
	- Generator>Start Generating. this can take some time to generate depending on the size.
	- File>Save>Navmesh, then goto this location and add the extention .nm (Navmesh.nm)
	- Modify your config.cpp refering to the new navmesh.
	- Repack your .pbo

===========================================CE Tool================================================================

	- At this point you should have a completed terrain, with all roads, buildings, vegetation in place. Your map is
		now about 85% complete, but now comes the task of setting up a mission file for your specific map.
	- Included with this pack is a folder (CeEditor_MyBrandNewMap) Bring this to your Reference folder.
	- Open up the folder and you can replace the satmap with your own.
	- Open up the areaflags.xml and change the map line to your new map file.
	- The Layers folder has been modified so all layers are blank.
	- The areaflags.xml has been reduced to its minimum for a new map. (I recommend keeping and using the colour territories
		used within this file. Using new colours will require more coding I am as yet unfamiliar with)
	- Open up the Economy Editor in the DayZ tools suite. Goto File>Load> and load the .xml file from that folder.
	- It will take a sec to load all the layers, but begin with the left column.
		- Go down the list and just paint in the areas where you need them.
		- On the right side you will find the Spawn AI section for territories spawns.
	- When completed Goto File>Save and Export All.
	- This will generate new files in your (CeEditor_MyBrandNewMap) folder.
		- Move the areaflag.map to your dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap, put it in with the init.c and cfg files.
		- In the territories folder you will find all your newly created territory files, move these to the
			env folder in your dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap.

===========================================Initialize Economy================================================================

	- Now you need the file (CE Generation info.
	- From your dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap (copy and save the init.c file, youll need this later.)
	- Open that init.c file and replace all the code with the first section of the (CE Generation info)
	- Now you want to open up the dayz launcher. Goto parameters
		- Check Mod and direct to your @MyBrandNewMap on your local HD
		- Check Mission and direct to the mission folder on your local HD (dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap)
		- Check Command Line and put: DayZDiag_x64.exe -window -nopause -mod=@YourModFolder -mission=dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap
	- Make sure you have no other mods installed and press play.
	- Load into your world and run around, make sure things are spawning here and there. check everything from loot to ZMB to animals.
	- Close the game.
	- Open your (dayzOffline.MyBrandNewMap) and delete the new 'storage' folder
	- Open the init.c and replace the whole thing with the 2nd section of (CE Generation info)
	- Save the file, load up dayz and play again.
	- Same thing, run around, give it a few minutes, then log out.
	- This creates some new files for food trees, and your POS file.
	
	- Congratulations, other than fine polishing your server files and events. all you have left is to publish your new map.

===========================================DS Utils================================================================

	- Open up DS Utils in DayZ Tools.
	- This is where you are going to create the keys for your map.
	- Set the directories and create your keys.
	- Put your private bikey in a safe place, (this is only for you.)
	- Put your public bikey in the Keys folder of your @mybrandnewmap of the DayZ root folder.

===========================================Test it on a local server===========================================================

	- You have 2 options, though offline mode is easier to setup and get into your map, there are some issues.
	- Open up DayZ launcher-Parameters-All Parameters- In the Advanced section check the Mission line, and paste the following line.
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ\Missions\DayZCommunityOfflineMode.MyBrandNewMap
	- Now rename the end of that line to your map name.
	- Goto your DayZ root folder-Missions(NOT mpmissions) and put your (DayZCommunityOfflineMode.MyBrandNewMap) file there.
	- Make sure that folder has your maps name at the end.
	- Back to the DZ Launcher-Mods, and click on Local Mod at the top. Direct to your @MyBrandNewMap in the DZ root folder.
	- Play your new map for the first time....
	- How to setup offline mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KEIpExhKM
	
	- Your other option is a local server. This is not a difficult thing to set up, but should be your choice as you can setup
		"test environments" that allow you to tweak different values. and you will get faster results than a cloud server.	
	- How to setup local server. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=facj4MYAjpg

	- Finally we have the live server, which you have to publish the map first(privately if youd like)
		and then subscribe and install like any other map mod, on your hosted/dedicated server.
	- You can use any vanilla server files that come in the offline folder, but you will have everything behaving and spawning
		as it would in chernarus, best thing is to modify the events.xml file and turn off all events for now, while you continue
		work on your map. There is alot of data that makes a server run, especially in the economy. Below is a list of thier purpose.
		
		mapgroupproto - building proxies for loot spawns [[Dont Change] or loot will not spawn in buildings.]
		mapgrouppos - building spawn locations for loot [this is where you add locations for new buildings.]
		mapgroupdirt - ???
		mapgroupcluster - vegetation locations for (edible?) spawns [same as mapgrouppos but for plants?]
		mapclusterproto - vegetation proxies for (edible?) spawns [[Dont Change]similar to mapgroupproto]
		cfgweather - the weather file/if enabled
		cfgspawnabletypes - the condition of your loot
		cfgrandompresets - the condition of and what gear can spawn on or in your loot
		cfgplayerspawnpoints - player spawn locations
		cfglimitsdefinitionuser - custom and combo definitions
		cfglimitsdefinition - common definitions
		cfgignorelist - types list to ignore (for something?)
		cfgeventspawns - event spawn locations/non living (can talk to the eventgroups.xml)
		cfgeventgroups - spawn proxies for dynamic events trains/convoys
		cfgenvironment - bahavioral info for livings
		cfgeconomycore - main economy file, use this to define various economy files.
		AreaFlags - not sure??? possible to do with Tiers for loot.
		cfgEffectArea - contaminated zones, and other affected areas.
		cfggameplay - world dynamics (stamina, temperature, server additions, player loadouts)
		init.c - startup parameters of the server???
		cfgundergroundtriggers - triggers info (make stuff dark, play sounds)
		
		types.xml - tells the game how much and in what variation to spawn loot, needs an entry for any item in game.
		events.xml - governs all the events of the server (can talk to the eventspawns.xml)
		globals.xml - global configuration of various server limits and behaviours.
		messages.xml - announce messages in your server using countdowns n such.
		economy.xml - tells the server what kind of actions to take on loot,playerinventory,vehicles
		
		All territory files govern anything 'living' that will spawn in the game.
			- this file is used instead of the cfgeventspawns. for the associated creature.
			
-----------------------------------------------Finishing up-------------------------------------------------------------

	- Publish your @mybrandnewmap.
	- You can decide to keep this private when you upload it to Steam, but to put on a server with freinds you should make
		it public.  This is your original piece of work, and you get to set the rules. If you dont want your map modified,
		that is certainly your right.  But you will have to keep track of all that.

=========================================================Starting with QGIS(Real Location Route)=================================

	- Start out in TerrainBuilder from the DayZ Tools Suite.
		- Create a new folder on your P: drive with whatever name you want
		- Create a new Mapframe
		- Name your new map and direct it to the folder you just created.
			- Click the Create subfolders button, this will create most of the folders you need.
				-data								-Created	(DayZ basefolder)
				-source								-Created	(DayZ basefolder)
					-landbuilder					-Created	(needed by Terrainbuilder)
					-shapefiles						-Created	(needed by Terrainbuilder)
					-TerrainBuilder					-Created	(Output folder for original files/saves)(Only if using this program)
					-TerrainProcessor				-Not Created(You can add these folders for thier output files)
					-QGIS							-Not Created(You can add these folders for thier output files)
